# StudentGradePrediction

In graduate studies, many students find it difficult to achieve good grades because they do not get much support in higher education courses 
compared to the support that students receive in schools. We can use machine learning for the student grades prediction task so that instructors 
can help students prepare for topics where student grades were predicted low.
